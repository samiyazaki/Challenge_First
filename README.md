# Challenge_First README

## Requirements
This is a website for a Search Engine Optimization company that requested a refactorization for their own SEO purposes. The website must possess streamlined code that would support their desires to increase their optimization and searchability on the internet while still providing the exact same look as presented.

## Project Notes
The project must follow the provided criteria and be a repo that is copied from and postable to GitHub.


## Setup
No setup required, just follow the link and view as needed.


## Files & directories
The primary file is the index.html file which is where the crux of the website lies. There is a Style.css sheet with cosmetic changes, 7 images for utilization throughout the website and this README file which is what you are currently reading.


## Credits
My instructors, my study group and the learning assistants who helped me erase and rebuild the website repeatedly.
